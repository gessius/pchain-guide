How to become validator
=========================

Before you vote to become validator by PIWallet, make sure you have done things bellow: 

- :ref:`set up the RPC URL <Local Node Mode>` 
- have at least 100k PI on your address

You can choose to apply candidates first so you can let other delegate to you. This is an option, not neccessity.

Pchain have 12 epochs per year, and in each epoch there are 4 phases.

+------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Phase      | Block Number                         | What you can do              | 
+============+======================================+==============================+
| 0% ~ 75%   | start_block ~ vote_start_block - 1   | apply candidates and delegate| 
+------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| 75% ~ 85%  | vote_start_block ~ vote_end_block    | vote                         |
+------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| 85% ~ 95%  | reveal_start_block ~ reveal_end_block| reveal vote                  |
+------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| 95% ~ 100% | reveal_end_block + 1 ~ end_block     | check next epoch's info      |
+------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+

You can check current phase in PIWallet **Epoch** page.

Now you can prepare the parameters will used during vote and reveal vote, you should have:

- address 
- consensus public key   //contains in priv_validator.json
- consensus private key  //contains in priv_validator.json
- amount           //should be at least 10k PI and equal or larger than total_depositProxiedBalance+total_proxiedBalance-total_pendingRefundBalance
- salt       

First of all, make sure you have bls' key for consensus, thy are included in file `priv_validator.json`. (If you don't have one, follow :ref:`Create Your Account` to generate). Here is an example.
