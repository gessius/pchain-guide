| If you do not want to run node on PCHAIN yourself, you can delegate PI to one / several Validator candidate(s) with PI wallet (Light wallet) during first phase.
| 1.Click “Delegate” tab, you will see the Candidate list there. If you want to get more info about one Candidate, you can click “detail ”.

2. Please make sure which chain and Candidate you want to delegate to. Then Click “Join”. 
3. Fill in the delegate amount with at least 1,000 PI. Ensure there is at least 0.00021 PI left in your balance for paying the gas fee.
The invite code is optional here, it’s designed for some programmes (not released now).

APPEND: You can delegate more PI to this Candidate before 75% of the Epoch height.
CANCEL: You can cancel delegation before 75% of the Epoch height.

6. “Delegate balance” is the amount you delegated to Candidate(s) who are mining blocks for reward as Validator(s) with your delegation.
“Delegate to ** Candidate nodes” means the number of Candidate node(s) as Validator(s) who are mining blocks for reward with your delegation. 
“Total pos mining reward” is the reward amount you got before 23:59:59 yesterday (UTC+8) . 
“The annual return” = the daily reward/ the delegated amount *365*100%

.. _Wallet Cancel Delegation:

========================
How to cancel delegation
========================

You can cancel delegation before the current Epoch reaches 75%.

1) If your candidate is validator in current Epoch, the cancelation will be effective immediately. Your PI will be automatically unlocked to your balance when the current Epoch reaches 100%.

2) If your candidate is not validator in current Epoch, then the cancelation will take effect immediately and your PI will be automatically unlocked to your balance.


| Choose the candidate that your want to cancel delegation to from the list. The default amount shows the total amount that you delegate to this address. 
| You can cancel with total delegation amount. Also, you can define the amount that you want to decrease but ensure the delegate balance to this address is equal or greater than 1,000 PI.

Noted: In general, the gas fee is about 0.00021 PI which will be directly paid from your balance.


=================================================
How to extract mining rewards from rewardBalance
=================================================

Noted:

- After PCHAIN mainnet upgraded to V1.2.0, the mining reward need to be extracted by users ( Validator nodes/ delegators) instead of being released automatically.
- After each epoch ends, you can extract the 1/12 mining reward at anytime. 
- You can’t define the extract amount. The amount is the total reward on one chain you can extract at that moment. 

1. Go to PIwallet “Delegate”.
Please ensure the address that you want to extract  reward to. And then click “Extract Reward”.
