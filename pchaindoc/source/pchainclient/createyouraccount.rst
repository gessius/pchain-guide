.. _Create Your Account:

===================
Create Your Account
===================

After running pchain, sooner or later you will want to create your own account. 
If you wanna 

- transfer PI
- delegate
- create a child chain
- deploy smart contrat
- interact with smart contract

you will only need to generate an address.
:: 
	pchain --datadir=yourdatadir account new
This command will generate a keystore file under your datadir, the file name usually start with "UTC". **We suggest you to keep this file on your local computer or import it to PIWallet**.

If you wanna also

- become a validator node to mining
- apply candidate node with delegations

you will also need to generate bls keys for mining.
:: 
	pchain --datadir=yourdatadir gen_priv_validator youraddress
This command will generate a priv_validator.json file under your datadir. This file should copy to the datadir/chainid/ if you wanna mining, and after that you should **restart** pchain.

Now please check your datadir's structure:
::
	datadir/
		-chaininfo.db/    
		-config.toml  
		-nodekey    
		-nodes/    
		-tx3cache/
		-pchain/
			-data/  
			-geth/  
			-pchain.ipc
			-priv_validator.json  
			-keystore/          

If you also run child chain and would like to mining on both main chain and child chain, your datadir's structure should look like this:
::
	datadir/
		-chaininfo.db/    
		-config.toml  
		-nodekey    
		-nodes/    
		-tx3cache/
		-pchain/
			-data/  
			-geth/  
			-pchain.ipc
			-priv_validator.json  
			-keystore/ 
		-child_0/
			-data/  
			-geth/  
			-pchain.ipc
			-priv_validator.json 
			-keystore/
