How to Apply Candidate node with delegations
============================================

Before you apply candidate node with delegations, make sure you have done things below: 

- sync and run pchain 
- have an address and consensus keys
- have at least 10k PI on your address

Pchain have 12 epochs per year, and in each epoch there are 4 phases. You can apply candidate node with delegations during the first phase.

+------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Phase      | Block Number                         | What you can do              | 
+============+======================================+==============================+
| 0% ~ 75%   | start_block ~ vote_start_block - 1   | apply candidates and delegate| 
+------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| 75% ~ 85%  | vote_start_block ~ vote_end_block    | vote                         |
+------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| 85% ~ 95%  | reveal_start_block ~ reveal_end_block| reveal vote                  |
+------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| 95% ~ 100% | reveal_end_block + 1 ~ end_block     | check next epoch's info      |
+------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+

You can check the current stage by our `Monitor <https://monitor.pchain.org>`_, our by RPC `tdm_getEpoch <https://github.com/pchain-org/pchain/wiki/JSON-RPC#tdm_getEpoch>`_.

Now you can prepare the parameters will used later, you should have:

- address 
- security deposit  //amount of the security deposit PI (minimum 10k PI)
- commission  // the commission fee percentage of each Block Reward be charged from delegators when Candidate elected to be a Validator node (between 0 - 100)

Note: you can also apply candidate node with delegations by PIWallet, it will make this process much easier.

Now you can apply candidate node with delegations by RPC `del_applycandidate <https://github.com/pchain-org/pchain/wiki/JSON-RPC#del_applycandidate>`_.
::
	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"del_applyCandidate","params":["address", "security deposit", commission],"id":1}' localhost:6969/chainid
After this you can check by RPC `del_checkcandidate <https://github.com/pchain-org/pchain/wiki/JSON-RPC#del_checkcandidate>`_.

**Importantly Noticed**: Please go to `Join Candidate List <https://pchain.org/joinCandidate>`_ to submit your introduction. Once your submission has been validated, you will be publicly listed on Recommended Candidates on PIWALLET. Detailed information increases your chances of convincing Delegators to support your candidacy.

.. _Client Cancel Candidate:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Cancel candidates
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Once you apply candidate node with delegations successfully, you can cancel it via calling for RPC or PCHAIN wallet PIwallet before the Epoch reaches 75%.
1) Canceling your submission after selected to be Validator: your staked PI will be unlocked and all the delegated tokens you received will be automatically returned to each delegator once the Epoch reaches 100% height.
2) Canceling your submission after you failed being elected Validator: the cancelation will be effective immediately since there are no Validator duties to be completed, your staked PI will be unlocked, and all the delegated tokens you received automatically returned to each delegator balance. 

If you don't want to be a Candidate node with delegations any longer , you can cancel by RPC `del_cancelcandidate <https://github.com/pchain-org/pchain/wiki/JSON-RPC#del_cancelcandidate>`_.
::
	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"del_cancelCandidate","params":["address"],"id":1}' localhost:6969/chainid
